## MJ Research, Inc. PTC-100

One of our well-used and older PCR machines suddenly presented an error message:

```console
Heat Pump Failure
``` 

Modern PCR machines all use thermoelectric elements, also called a Peltier element (when electricity is used to generate
a temperature differential) or a Seebeck generator (when a temperature differential is used to generate electricity).
The "heat pump" referred to in the error message is the peltier element. Let's take it apart to see how it failed..

The semiconductor layer had cracks and burns where the black conductor is connected and the part connected to the red (positive) cable came off
when removing the module. Thermal expansion and contraction over many years caused it to crack. The only fix is to replace the module.
To find a good replacement module it must be rated appropriately.

The PTC-100 has two peltier modules wired in series, the power supply measure 34 V with no load and about 26-28 V at a current of 4-5 A. This is not 
very relevant though as the power supply is current-controlled. Each module measure 1.37-1.4 &Omega; (Ohm) at 100 Hz.

The replacement modules I decided on was RC12-6-01LS from Marlow Industries, Inc. With the following ratings:

```console
Current - max	5.6 A	
Voltage - max	14.7 V	
Resistance -	2.2 Ohms	
Operating temperature	130Â°C
```
These modules should work perfectly for this application at only $36 USD / ea and the exposed tabs lets you solder the old wires directly to the new. When installed
in the instrument it works fine and heats up as fast (if not slightly faster) than with the original modules.

Unfortunately the slightly higher resistance of 2.2 &Omega; is fooling the instrument causing it to display a service message on boot.

The instrument is now reading a lower current at the same voltage which would normally indicate degraded peltier elements. In this case it's not a problem and the
service message can be skipped.
